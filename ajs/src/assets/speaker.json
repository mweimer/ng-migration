Greg's current position is VP of Technology Ventures for Atlas Lift Tech, where he is in charge of re-envisioning a resource intensive company into a technology company.\r\n\r\nFor the past eight years, Greg has focused on the common problems plaguing IT departments, focusing on solutions. Greg's primary method is to examine problems from a variety of perspective, find the common patterns and then build frameworks that can work in a wide variety of organizations. He brings this same method to speaking, using analogies, abstractions and stories to simplify intermediate and advanced concepts for beginning audiences. Greg has spoken at numerous conferences and user groups across the country and generally takes a contrarian view of the silver bullets that plague the field.\r\n\r\nWhen Greg is not on the road, he is working from his home office, or spending time with his wife, four daughters and his derpy dog. When not working, he can often be found seeking out another new craft beer, playing pub trivia or seeking out a geek boardgame night.",

He's a long-time Sys/Ops Engineer, enjoys leading teams, and is active in the DevOps community.  He may or may not be Batman.  He is pretty keen on helping orgs stop hurting themselves, insight tooling (trending / monitoring / alerting), and automation in general, and actually enjoys public speaking.  He takes joy in helping teams and orgs to stop hurting themselves.  He hates writing about himself in the third person, and aspires to one day be a better bio writer.",

    "bio": "Walt's enthusiasm for crafting software interfaces blossomed early. Just a few days after discovering how to move pixels around a computer screen he was devouring books on the topic of computer graphics and UI design. Before long he was sharing his discoveries with other technology buffs, a lifelong pursuit that has led to teaching engagements at universities, private training companies and the international conference circuit. His experimentation continues to this day, ranging from writing API extensions, learning about IDEs, mobile development and the web. As a consultant he has worked with a wide spectrum of clients, including UPS, HP, Wintellect and Intel. He is now a staff instructor at LinkedIn Learning, where his content team produces hundreds of technical training courses for software developers each year.\r\nIn an earlier phase of life, he was a professional musician, first working jobs as a trombonist, later exploring music with keyboards and synthesizers.
