        "title": "A Better, Faster Pipeline for Software Delivery",
        "description": "The software delivery pipeline is the process of taking features from developers and getting them delivered to customers. The earliest tests should be the quickest and easiest to run, giving developers the fastest feedback. Successive rounds of testing should increase confidence that the code is a viable candidate for production and that more expensive tests—be it time, effort, cost—are justified. Manual testing should be performed toward the end of the pipeline, leaving computers to do as much work as possible before people get involved. Although it is tempting to arrange the delivery pipeline in phases (e.g., functional tests, then acceptance tests, then load and performance tests, then security tests), this can lead to problems progressing down the pipeline.\r\n\r\nIn this interactive workshop, you will learn how to arrange your pipeline, automated or not, and so each round of tests provides just enough testing to give you confidence that the next set of tests is worth the investment. You'll explore how to get the right types of testing into your pipeline at the right points so that you can determine which builds are viable candidates for production.\r\n\r\nAttendees should be at least roughly familiar with their current delivery process, or at least have a process in mind. No prior knowledge of DevOps, continuous delivery, or automation is assumed.\r\n",

        "title": "Best Practices for Robust API development in ASP.NET Core",
        "description": "This  workshop will walk developers through the design and implementation of a robust API layer using Visual Studio 2017, C#, and the ASP.NET Core stack. Today's client-centric architectures frequently involve a mix of UI frameworks such as Angular, React, or even native mobile apps targeting iOS, Android, or Windows devices. One common requirement for each of these modern application frameworks is the need to communicate data back to the server via an easily accessible API layer. As developers who frequently work on both the API and the client, the overall development process needs to support the ability to quickly add code to both layers and to have an efficient debugging experience.\r\n\r\nThis class will walk all attendees through designing such an API on the Microsoft stack that is flexible, easy to debug, easy to extend, and supports a number of advanced features commonly required by today's architectures. As the class progresses we will work through the full implementation of a secure API that demonstrates a wide variety of real-world scenarios. We will discuss and demonstrate a clean, back-end architecture isolating all data access into an organized repository layer utilized by higher-level business services. We will also demonstrate how this API can be utilized across a number of UI frameworks including an SPA written in Angular and a cross-platform mobile application developed in Xamarin. The focus will be on setting up an efficient development process between these clients and the API. All students will be encouraged to implement all features locally and the overall content will be presented in a very \"hands on\" manner. All code and sample projects will also be provided via a public GitHub repository so that attendees can leverage the core concepts in their own projects upon completion of the course.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "Software is eating the world, but do engineers have the knowledge of the stakeholder's domain to bear the responsibility of transferring domain knowledge to software? The Rosetta Stone of software is to have a domain language that clearly communicates in the language of the field, but developers struggle to get past communication problems:\r\n\r\n- Misunderstood requirements.\r\n- Lost context over time.\r\n- Code that does not capture intent properly.\r\n- Unintended consequences of poorly modeled data. \r\n\r\nOur workflows and structures create communication barriers we must break down in order to move our implementations closer to their domains. As developers, our goals should include moving code closer to the vocabulary of the domain. This requires understanding not only the problem being solved by a feature but also, more broadly an understanding of the field we are working in. \r\n\r\nDesign thinking offers a toolset for gathering insight into the domain that can not only help engineers understand a user's problem more fundamentally, it can also offer byproducts such as:\r\n\r\n- Providing a better understanding of the entire domain. \r\n- A clearer path to a domain language. \r\n- Understanding problem nuance.\r\n- Gaining lessons learned of the user. \r\n\r\nThis workshop walks users through a design thinking exercise with an emphasis on being the engineer in the room. We will break into groups and follow a process of exploring the problem space, make CodeMash better for volunteers and attendees. The workshop will be focused on user interviews, capturing vocabulary, ideation techniques, prototyping and user validation. The outcome is a better understanding of how to capture value from these types of session that lead to the development of domain-centric data structures, domain languages, better DB structures, and clearer documentation with more user validation and better long-term understanding of the code base and product.",

In this session attendees will build a 2D Platformer game (full of traps) from start to finish. Covered is a hands on approach to the construction of game systems from assets. Audience members won’t be watching, they’ll be doing. The end product will be a complete video game playable on desktop, web, or mobile devices. This is all new content showing you how to use the latest features of the engine. Even if you attended previously there will still be plenty of new things to learn!

        "description": "Threat modeling is a way of thinking about what could go wrong and how to prevent it. Instinctively, we all think this way in regards to our own personal security and safety. When it comes to building software, some software shops either skip the important step of threat modeling in secure software design or, they have tried threat modeling before but haven't quite figured out how to connect the threat models to real world software development and its priorities. Threat modeling should be part of your secure software design process. Using threat modeling and some principals of risk management, you can design software in a way that makes security one of the top goals, along with performance, scalability, reliability, and maintenance.\r\n\r\nObjective: In this workshop, attendees will be introduced to Threat Modeling, learn how to conduct a Threat Modeling session, learn how to use practical strategies in finding Threats and how to apply Risk Management in dealing with the threats. Depending on time, we will go through 1 or 2 Real World Threat Modeling case studies. Finally, we will end the day with common gotchas in Threat Modeling and how to watch out for them.",

Yes, we have the technology to turn those boring silhouettes into 3D. During this session, you will 3D scan each other’s heads to make a 3D model. You will then use 3D computer software to add some finishing touches to the model and 3D print them. Your grandparents will love having a lifelike 3D printed version of you for their mantel.",

        "description": "This  workshop will walk developers through the design and implementation of a robust API layer using Visual Studio 2017, C#, and the ASP.NET Core stack. Today's client-centric architectures frequently involve a mix of UI frameworks such as Angular, React, or even native mobile apps targeting iOS, Android, or Windows devices. One common requirement for each of these modern application frameworks is the need to communicate data back to the server via an easily accessible API layer. As developers who frequently work on both the API and the client, the overall development process needs to support the ability to quickly add code to both layers and to have an efficient debugging experience.\r\n\r\nThis class will walk all attendees through designing such an API on the Microsoft stack that is flexible, easy to debug, easy to extend, and supports a number of advanced features commonly required by today's architectures. As the class progresses we will work through the full implementation of a secure API that demonstrates a wide variety of real-world scenarios. We will discuss and demonstrate a clean, back-end architecture isolating all data access into an organized repository layer utilized by higher-level business services. We will also demonstrate how this API can be utilized across a number of UI frameworks including an SPA written in Angular and a cross-platform mobile application developed in Xamarin. The focus will be on setting up an efficient development process between these clients and the API. All students will be encouraged to implement all features locally and the overall content will be presented in a very \"hands on\" manner. All code and sample projects will also be provided via a public GitHub repository so that attendees can leverage the core concepts in their own projects upon completion of the course.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "In this full-day workshop, you’ll learn how to build a single-page app with React. We’ll discuss the fundamentals of React development, the “React” way of building apps, and suggestions for writing maintainable React code. You’ll get hands-on experience with JSX, React Router, several methods of managing state, and testing tools like Jest and Enzyme.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be creating an app to manage all the adorable kittens in our lives. The React landscape is extensive, and we can’t cover it all - but you’ll leave this workshop feeling confident to build your next app with React.\r\n\r\nThis session includes a healthy balance of instruction and hands-on activities. We’ll cover a broad variety of topics required to build a React app:\r\n\r\n* React fundamentals\r\n* Modern features of JavaScript that ease React development\r\n* The ‘Component’ mindset\r\n* JSX, a strange-looking hybrid between JavaScript and HTML\r\n* Verifying component inputs\r\n* Styling React components\r\n* Routing\r\n* State management\r\n* Automated testing\r\n* Best practices\r\n\r\nExperience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required. You’ll need Git v2.15.0 or higher, NodeJS v8.9.4 or higher, NPM v5.6.0 or higher, and a text editor of your choosing.\r\n\r\nA URL with specific prerequisite instructions and code/instructions for the exercises will be provided prior to the event.",

        "description": "In the very early days of Agile development and Test Driven Development, we strove to structure our code such that we could write isolated unit tests with little or no coupling to infrastructure. Great, and it helped, but frequently that led to more complicated code internals and you still had issues from interactions with said infrastructure. What if instead, we could more effectively do quick, reliable integration testing? Could that simplify some of our code -- especially when combined with microservice architectures? Do we need to reconsider where our efforts go in the old \"testing pyramid?\" How does ASP.Net Core support far better server side testing than previous versions? Where does HTTP contract testing fit in? Can Docker help us out? Should we pursue other techniques besides just trying to use Selenium? What about using alternative NoSQL style databases? Or if I'm stuck with relational databases, what can we do to soften the aggravations? \r\n\r\nI'll try to address all these questions and tackle automated testing best practices in this workshop.",

        "description": "Talking Cars: From Can't to CAN\r\n\r\nModern vehicles are critically vulnerable. They rely on many electronic computers and sensors which communicate by broadcasting critical information over many Controller Area Networks (CANs). Previous research has shown that a vehicle’s network has dangerous implications—hackers can collect data from remote vehicles and even disrupt vehicle control. Despite the relative simplicity of the network, there is a steep learning curve which can serve as a barrier of entry for would-be researchers and developers. Moreover, many interfaces and tools to communicate with a vehicle’s CAN are expensive and difficult for a novice to use. In lieu of traditional interfaces, many developers opt for the do-it-yourself route and build their own devices with clever programming and a single-board computer. This pre-compiler will focus on the nuts-and-bits of CAN including construction of an automotive Raspberry Pi interface which will be used to read, inject, and analyze the properties of a vehicular network.​ Attendees will get hands-on experience building the interface and interacting with automobiles, starting with physical construction of the device up to implementing basic CAN functions with Python libraries. After the workshop concludes, attendees will have the option to take their Raspberry Pi interface home and begin exploring their own vehicles!*\r\n\r\n*Requires ticket/waiver.

You will learn why Aspect Ratio and wire gauge are important considerations in making your chainmail.  We will also delve into the history of each type of chain mail weave and why they were used in different parts of the world.  At the end of the lesson, you should have a finished piece of chainmail, either a bracelet, a necklace or simply a large square.  We will be using a variety of anodized aluminum that is very colorful and easy to work with.",

        "description": "Containers are one of the hottest technologies in our industry today. They are like virtual machines but smaller and faster. They can provide on-demand, disposable test environments that start quickly, repeatably, locally or in the cloud. When you want, you can tear down the environment and recreate a pristine copy within seconds. And since the process is automated, anyone on the team can use the same commands to get their own test systems. Then, when you finish testing, those containers can be deployed directly into production. At each stage, the environments for development, test, and production will all look and behave the same.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is a hands-on introduction for anyone interested in learning about containers in general and more specifically Docker–you will need your laptop. You will walk through building docker containers, starting out simple but moving to more pragmatic setups. You’ll test those systems locally and in the cloud. As you iterate, you will build out tests and capabilities. And then Gene will show you how all of this evolves to a full-blown, production-ready setup.",

It’s easy to push it aside and say you’ll do it later or to forget entirely. It’s easy to drop a couple WIA-ARIA tags into your HTML and move on, but this doesn’t address many accessibility needs. When was the last time you used your website with your eyes closed?\r\n\r\nLet’s do just that. Let’s try to navigate a website with a blindfold on. Let’s try to use a website without a mouse. Let’s try navigating a website with a visual impairment. And then let’s fix the problems encountered.\r\n\r\nWe will focus on experiencing website with two types of impairments:\r\n* Visual impairments, such as color blindness, low visual acuity, and a complete lack of vision\r\n* Mobility impairments, preventing users from using a mouse for input\r\n\r\nThese impairments of quite common and are simple to simulate using a combination of browser extensions and existing tools in your operating system. For each impairment, we will look at how the markup (both the semantic structure and the attributes), the colors and contract, tab order, and focus affect the experience. And for each issue we encounter, we will look at specific ways that experience can be improved.\r\n\r\nLast, we will look at testing strategies to audit your code for potential accessibility issues, using extensions such as Google’s Lighthouse, Deque’s axe-engine, and others.",

This is a snide remark, uttered only by folks who historically partake in great privilege. Those who have never once found themselves considered the “other”. To the contrary, we are all considerably more secure in our affairs, not just from the threat of oppressive, authoritarian governments, but from criminals, oppressive employers and partners, with proper application of strong encryption and privacy tools.\r\n\r\nCryptoParty is a global, decentralized movement to inform folks about general security and privacy practices. These sorts of practices are generally applicable and valuable to folks looking to protect themselves from invasive mass surveillance and hackers. Beyond general privacy, and with current events what they are, there are a lot of folks looking to organize, protest, and participate in acts of resistance. Here, we'll learn these encryption and privacy basics along with how and when to apply them.\r\n\r\nCome with your devices ready to install some tools and practice online privacy.",

But those APIs are where all of the business logic for the application is exposed, and can hide some pretty nasty bugs. Web services and APIs can be tested in isolation, but they can also be tested in combination with the UI. Understanding how the UI and API work together can make it easier to troubleshoot when things go wrong from the UI. Having this understanding can also create a more complete picture of the application under test.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will cover:\r\n\r\nWhy web services and APIs are important to test\r\nThe differences between common types of web services\r\nHow HTTP Response Codes fit in to your testing\r\nHow familiar UI tests translate to API tests\r\nHow to use Postman to test and share tests with your team\r\nHow to find the API calls your UI is making",

You'll see how to store data on the phone, both in configuration files and in a SQLite database, and how to test whether you have a network connection and how to sync your data with a server when you are online.  You'll see how to interact with the phone's hardware, and how to work with images.  \r\n\r\nFinally, you'll work with Microsoft's app center to get analytics and crash reports, and to build and distribute your apps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "Often, companies have dozens of internal applications, all tied to managing the business. Authenticating users, managing user access, and protecting data endpoints separately can be a complete mess, but external single sign-on systems like Facebook Connect or Google aren’t always an option and commercial systems are expensive. Instead, you can build your own! In this workshop, you can learn to build your own single sign-on systems using IdentityServer, a trusted library that implements OpenID Connect and pairs well with the existing .NET identity elements that you know and trust. Through an in-house effort, you can have your own single sign-on system to manage users, protect data, and eliminate the mess.\r\n\r\nTopics\r\n- An introduction to OpenID Connect\r\n- Building an Identity Provider with IdentityServer and OpenID Connect.\r\n- Authenticating users: Building independent web applications authenticated by the Identity Provider.\r\n- Authenticating users: Building independent native applications authenticated by the Identity Provider.\r\n- Protecting data: Building data endpoints and APIs protected by the Identity Provider.\r\n- Protecting data: Managing user identities and personally-identifiable information protected by the Identity Provider.\r\n- Authenticating services: Building offline services and jobs that need to access protected data.\r\n- Managing applications, users, and requirement changes within the Identity Provider.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n- Familiarity with .NET, ASP.NET, and C#.\r\n- Familiarity with ASP.NET Identity.\r\n- Your own laptop with the latest version of .NET Core SDK and an editor/IDE of your choice.",

But the same strategies that work well at the UI level can also be applied to the web services and APIs that power your application.  By exploring your APIs you can find critical bugs earlier in the development cycle, gain a deeper understanding of how your application or feature works, and have greater confidence in your UI level testing, knowing that the services underneath are solid. The workshop will include multiple activities using Postman and other tools so that attendees can gain confidence in their ability to test web services.",

But, it also can be used to make art. You’ll learn briefly about the science and history of duct tape before we turn you loose to build your very own duct tape creation. Create a hat, shoes, flower, bird, or wallet, or just about anything else you can imagine with duct tape. We will supply ideas, how-to’s for several common projects, scissors, and tons of duct tape. You just bring your creativity! All ages welcome, though younger children should have a parent or older sibling to help them with scissors... and keep them from getting stuck to anything.",

        "description": "For many of us, it’s hard to speak up when we notice our teammates struggling. We don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or make things awkward. Sometimes it just feels like too much work to organize our thoughts into a coherent message that could help someone who’s falling behind move forward. Even knowing when it’s time to draw attention to a problem can be challenging.\r\n\r\nWe’ll start the session by covering our bases. When should we address uncomfortable situations at work? How can we keep personal feelings from derailing the conversation? And what happens afterward? Can we evaluate the effectiveness of our feedback? How can we move forward, growing as a team? We’ll answer these questions as we begin to build the skills necessary to provide teammates with specific, actionable feedback. Participants will receive a reference sheet to help them remember these techniques and work through difficult conversations in the real world.\r\n\r\nSeveral sections of the workshop will involve hands-on role-playing exercises. Participants will be broken up into small groups and given several scenarios to work through. Each scenario will outline a challenging situation from multiple points of view to help participants further explore the techniques and principles covered in the lecture portion of the session.",

Additionally, today's cloud based deployments virtually guarantee that services will not have static addresses in the network. So building systems that rely on microservices can be a challenge.\r\n\r\nFortunately, some good patterns have emerged in the form of circuit breakers - for dealing with failure, and service discovery - for dealing with network changes.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will explore service discovery and circuit breakers using the Spring Cloud Netflix  library which implements Netflix Eureka for service discovery and Netflix Hystrix for circuit breakers.",

But – like most best practices – a practical implementation is challenging (and time consuming). Your team is convinced they are a great idea. You’ll have an opportunity to squash bugs in the least costly of development times, learn new things from your talented teammates, and build a stronger foundation of trust. Awesome. Everyone is on board. But now what? What tools are out there? What are you actually looking for? How often should the reviews happen? In this talk, you’ll get a practical guide to making code reviews effective. Whether you’re the reviewer or reviewee: there are ways to make sure this really is a great idea.",

        "description": "You are transition to microservices, you have remote teams, you are wanting to update existing services, you are doing all three. The consistent theme in all of these needs is that they require collaboration across teams and concerns. A common problem however with collaboration is that there is often a lot of wait time. Team A needs for team B to implement and deploy a service, update a service, or figure out why a service isn’t working correctly, this can be a very frustrating process and instead of collaborating you feel like you are competing! There is a better way though and that is with contract driven development! \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will learn about the goals and processes behind contract driven development. Once we have the underlying principles figured out, we will switch to the practical and look at using Spring Cloud Contract to write contracts. Spring Cloud Contract offers several approaches for writing contracts and we will cover them so your organization can choose which would be the best fit. If you have been frustrated by wait times from with working other services and teams, then this will definitely want to attend this presentation!",

Why have graphs grown so fast in popularity? First, they are designed for modeling data architecutres when working with highly connected data and can offer superior performance for analyzing highly connected data, especially in real-time. They also offer significant flexiblity and support on-the-fly, frequent schema changes, which is great for managing constantly changing data architectures.  This talk will review the graph landscape and provide an overview of many options, specifically:\r\n\r\n- Graph Database Use Cases\r\n- When not to use a Graph Database\r\n- Graph Databases in the NOSQL world\r\n- Pros & Cons of Graph Database options, including: Arango, Cosmos DB (Azure), dGraph, JanusGraph, Neo4j, Neptune (Amazon), Spark + GraphX\r\n",

The test framework Spock became a welcome alternative for many projects fearless to adopt Groovy as part of their polyglot software stack.\r\n\r\nWith the first GA release of JUnit 5 in September 2017, the JUnit team brought real innovation to the established space of testing JVM code. Not only is the release packed with new features comparable to the ones provided by Spock, JUnit 5 also serves as a platform for launching other test frameworks on the JVM.\r\n\r\nThis demo-driven talk compares typical testing usage patterns and features available for JUnit 5 and Spock. You'll leave with a firm understanding of the benefits and tradeoffs delivered by both test frameworks.",

        "description": "It all started with a DIY project to use Computer Vision for security cameras at home. A custom Machine Learning model is the core component used to analyze pictures to detect people, animals and more in a house environment. The AI processing is performed at the edge, in dedicated hardware and the collected information is stored in the cloud.\r\nThe same idea can be applied to several CCTV scenarios, like parking lots, train stations, malls and more. However, moving this into enterprise scale brings a set of challenges, which are going to be described and explained in this session.\r\n",

        "description": "Change begins at home. Many first generation disadvantaged immigrants to this country do not attend college, which means their children do not have adequate guidance on pursing higher-level education. The community can come together to provide help to these children with code camps.  This past summer, a Young Women in Tech code camp was held in Columbus for members of the Bhutanese-Nepali Refugee Community. More than a dozen experts in technology volunteered to teach girls aged 13-17 about computer programming, accessibility, user-centered design processes, cyber security, Photoshop, software development and desktop management. The volunteers taught the girls about the extensive career options within technology, with each volunteer focusing on their respective area of expertise. The training was supplemented by college admissions officers providing education guidance and a course on resume building. The entire camp was sponsored by a local community college with financial support for meals, equipment, and clothing provided by local businesses.\r\n\r\nIn this session, the audience will learn how to uplift the next generation of leaders through supplemental training opportunities outside of school. The audience will be shown how to organize a code camp locally, from securing facilities for training, to financial support, to soliciting volunteer teachers in technology. \r\n",

It was realized through frustration dealing with modern .NET applications built on unsustainable principles that required major surgery.   \r\n\r\nIn this session, you will learn\r\n* Why refactor over rebuild works as a rule\r\n* When you should pitch the rule and choose to rebuild\r\n* How the strangulation pattern works to reduce risk during modernization\r\n* Why automated testing is critical to success\r\n",

The goal of the alchemist is to produce a Master Work by steadily improving the mind and the body. When seeking the best outcome in UX, there is hardly a difference. We'll explore the practice of using cyphers such as the Gestalt principles of design and the transmutation of base concepts like the Golden Ratio, and place what we find in our crucible of rapid prototypes. We'll consider what emerges as prophesied by agile usability testing and with some luck find the Elixir of Life contained in the UX Philosopher's Stone - a collection of tools and techniques for practicing UX Alchemy.

This alternate approach is new for most of us, and it is justified to have a healthy level of skepticism towards any shiny new and often over-hyped solution. However, what is interesting is that this is so new that even the champions and evangelists often overlook the real benefits provided by this new way of capturing and storing data.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will look at 7 of the top reasons for using Event Sourcing & CQRS. These reasons covered go beyond the often referenced benefits, such as event stores are natural audit logs, or offering the ability to go back in history to replay past events. The primary goal of this talk is to flip your view from limited to no use of ES & CQRS to an alternate perspective of what you give up when you elect to not use it as the go-to persistence strategy.",

Ionic provides a framework that allows developers to build applications using familiar web technologies in order to produce a native application experience for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Unlike other frameworks that can be extremely expensive, Ionic is completely free and backed by a vibrant community of millions of developers who have used Ionic to build more than 5 million apps. This talk will provide a brief introduction to Ionic and will look at how to get started developing, testing and deploying your apps. We will also look at how to take advantage of native phone services using Ionic.",

However, this mentality can lead to wasted time and money going down the path of implementing a heavy-handed solution that doesn’t fit your business problem. Navigating the waters of AI, machine learning and data analysis can be tricky, especially when being sold by the myriad of data science and AI companies offering solutions at the enterprise level. But fear not, some simple guidelines can help. In this talk, I will present a basic rubric for evaluating AI and data analytics techniques as potential solutions for enterprise business problems.",

        "description": "Full regression as a release testing strategy might be useful for shaking out a lot issues in the product prior to release, but it is an extremely expensive exercise and does not guarantee that the highest priority issues are discovered. If the success of your release is reliant upon the experience of a target user in a target market, a list of 100 minor issues that user would not care about is not valuable. Pressing every button in the product to produce that list is not practical. One alternative strategy for release testing is scenario testing: a powerful exploratory technique that uncovers bugs that users care about.\r\n\r\nIn this experience report, software tester Sydney Frandsen will discuss how TechSmith's Camtasia team revamped their pre-release team testing from a spreadsheet-based checklist of functional regression tests to a scenario-based activity that shook out issues most impactful to their customers. By focusing on the workflows heavily trafficked by target users, the Camtasia development team was able to identify the issues that truly needed addressing before their release. Sydney will present the value of scenario testing as it relates to release testing, how she demonstrated and maximized test coverage using this technique, and battle-tested techniques that any team could use to make whole-team scenario testing both fun and productive.\r\n",

        "description": "Have you ever been curious about how to design a game?  Or maybe you would like to make games when you grow up? If yes, then here's your chance to learn about how to take your ideas, discover what makes them \"fun\", and work in teams to create a board game prototype in just a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nIn this KidzMash Divez session, participants will learn the basic principles of game design and development by collaborating in a board game jam. Game jams are quick exercises to experiment with ideas and build a playable board game prototype. Participants will work in teams to brainstorm their games before they create the rules, artwork, and playing pieces for their prototype based on a common theme. As they work together, attendees will experience how development teams are structured, learn about play-testing and iterating on ideas, and setting achievable project goals. The overall experience will be a friendly, guided introduction into the steps for developing an idea into a product within the context of creating a physical board game.\r\n \r\nLimit: 30 participants, ages 12 – 17, materials will be supplied, no electronics necessary.\r\n",

What will give the best flexibility and extensibility? Do I need a persistence layer or a cache?\r\n\r\nDepending on the specific application area and the structure of the data being transmitted, the requirements will be different: for example, an electronic options trading engine has different needs from a SaaS web application.\r\n\r\nThis talk will compare a variety of contemporary messaging solutions and the benefits and tradeoffs involved: \r\n\r\n- Kafka offers a persistent datastore and a clustering solution based on a \"pub-sub\" (publish-subscribe) architecture;\r\n- RabbitMQ is a message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol;\r\n- ZeroMQ implements a brokerless architecture that provides a socket-like abstraction to enable a variety of possible message distribution patterns.\r\n\r\nAnd finally: what do you gain and what do you lose from rolling your own simple messaging solution? Under what circumstances is the DIY approach the best one?\r\n\r\nThis talk offers a fast tour through a variety of messaging technologies and compares the pros and cons of each technology. Examples are shown in Python to favor simplicity and brevity of presentation over implementation details.",

Unfortunately, many college programs and bootcamps are leaving students ill-prepared for life in the working world of computer professionals.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll present a dozen areas of knowledge that every programmer should know, but may not have learned, or learned with enough depth.  We'll cover techncial skills like SQL and regular expressions, soft skills like working effectively with other coders, and everything in between.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to make the leap into the world of programming, or to make your first big move to the next job, you'll learn where you should beef up your skills to make sure you can hit the ground running.\r\n\r\n",

These components help you follow best practices, free you from writing boilerplate code, and simplify complex tasks, so you can focus on the code you care about.\"\r\n\r\nSounds great, right?  But what exactly are these components?  They're collections of libraries, separate from the platform APIs, which we can bring into our apps as we wish.  Each component can be added separately as needed without worry about which version of Android our users are on.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover all four types of components (Foundation, Architecture, Behavior, and UI), discuss how we can use key components, and even go through an app made from the ground up with Jetpack in mind.\r\n",

It doesn't take long until we are in a hard sell to our manager to ditch the legacy app and bring in the latest framework hotness. \r\n\r\nBut we overlook what we will be losing...years of code, untold amounts of business logic, depths of the application with git blame dates measured in years. A rewrite can be an undertaking that may never get fully completed but will sink a company. \r\n\r\nEnter React. \r\n\r\nSure, React does a great job starting with create-react-app, but what it does extremely well is tying into existing applications so that you can slowly convert legacy apps to the new JavaScript landscape. No rewrite, no stop of feature development and all the benefits of working in ES6.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we are going to talk about why we instinctively reach for the \"rewrite\" solution and look at some legacy Rails app that faced distinction. Then we will talk through what React is, what it can do, how it is so beneficial and give you the tools to leave and start converting your app with React today!",

If it’s to run away screaming, you are not alone.\r\n\r\nDevelopers often tend to focus on the negative aspects of legacy codebases. We think of legacy codebases as boring, outdated, difficult to work with, and overwhelming, and we overlook the opportunity to learn from them. These codebases are full of valuable knowledge and they can teach us to be disciplined, empathetic, and persistent.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will share ways to  approach legacy code with a more constructive attitude and focus on growth. We will also look at  techniques to help us better understand  and improve our legacy codebases.\r\n\r\nIt’s my hope that you’ll leave feeling excited and empowered to discover the hidden gems that your legacy codebase has to offer.",

By surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals, each coming into the conversation with their own thoughts, perspective, and motivations, the overall group can lift themselves to a higher level.  You don't need to wear a crown or command an army to be in a mastermind group.  Average people every day meet and discuss their careers and personal lives within constructive, judgement-free zones.  \r\n\r\nDo you find yourself going to work each day without direction?  Do you feel like you are the only person in the world with the problems you're facing?  A mastermind group would help you push forward.  This presentation will discuss how to join or organize a mastermind group, including meeting structure and timing.  What are the do's and don'ts?  How can every member benefit?

        "description": "When should we test our data? From an application development perspective, a unit test against a database isn't a unit test at all. Which makes sense -- connected systems introduce overhead and dependency, both of which reduce stability and decrease productivity during test-driven development (TDD). But if we wait for integration testing, critical functionality can get missed. In this session, we will discuss strategies for filling the data testing gap, directly within a Microsoft SQL Server environment. If you do a lot of work in T-SQL but aren't familiar with TDD, you'll learn the why and how of test-first development. If you're accomplished with unit tests, but never tried them in your database, you'll learn how to apply familiar concepts like setup, mocking, and assertion. We'll spend most of our time walking through a solution based on a real-world project, specifically using the open source tSQLt database unit testing framework.",

How can they get the async goodness?\r\n\r\nIn this code-heavy session, we'll take a \"older\" .NET web app which has no asynchronous code and slowly refactor it into a modern async app.  Along the way, there'll be discussions what practices we need to be aware of, such as \"async all the way down\".  This session also demonstrates when async/await is NOT needed, as well as when it is.\r\n\r\nAsync/await is wonderful, but it's not a cure-all.

        "description": "Building IoT products is hard.\r\n\r\nThere’s spotty internet connectivity, limited physical access to devices, and the added complexity of software across cloud and edge devices.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore distributed tracing, a new tool for debugging complex systems. We’ll see how distributed tracing can be especially useful for debugging the complex environments found while building IoT products.\r\n\r\nWe’ll show how distributed tracing lets us view our real traffic, in production, and quickly diagnose errors at any point in the request flow, whether it’s in the cloud or on our edge devices. You’ll come away with an understanding of how to incorporate traces into your software, and how tracing radically simplifies the process of debugging applications across connected devices.\r\n",

I had no idea where my career was going. Times change. Today I am a lead engineer at a major consultancy, work with Fortune 500 companies, make six-figures, and live debt-free (I also speak at conferences, mentor fellow developers, and travel the country).\r\n\r\nWhat happened?\r\n\r\nHow did I go from average to awesome in a few short years? The path of self-improvement is full of challenges, but challenges bring opportunity. I learned to embrace opportunity, navigate around obstacles, and learn from mistakes. This session will highlight real tips and advice for setting proper goals and how to measurably progress towards them. Let my stories, lessons, and experiences inspire you to achieve real goals and be your very best, even if \"imposter syndrome\" is your middle name.",

        "description": "Native iOS development requires cool languages, like Swift... that you’ll never use anywhere else. The development environment is painful: build tools straight out of the 80's, certificate hell, TestFlight weirdness. And Android development may be even worse!  React Native uses tools and languages you already know—JavaScript and React—to build native apps that use real native components. Meanwhile, Expo is a cloud-based app building service that eliminates just about all the native pain points not addressed by React Native itself. Just upload your code and out comes a signed native binary that even supports OTA updates without the App Store. There’s no need to ever touch an Xcode or Android Studio project. You’ll learn the core concepts behind React Native and Expo, peek under the hood of a live example wired up to data and navigation, and see how to build a store-ready app in just a few simple commands.",

        "description": "You are probably familiar with the object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, but what about the actor model?  The actor model is designed for concurrent programming and is an easy way to create systems that do many things at once.  For example, the actor model is an excellent way to implement IoT (Internet of Things) applications or take advantage of the processing power of multiple CPU cores.  Actors provide a natural way to model and reason about concurrent systems, especially for developers working in object-oriented languages.  In this session, you will learn the fundamentals of the actor model. You will learn how actors work, communicate, and act as state machines.  You will see how groups of actors cooperate in distributed, scalable, and fault tolerant systems.  The session will include code examples in Akka.NET, which is a toolkit for C# and F#.  At the end of this session, you will know the strengths and weaknesses of actor systems, and when they may help you solve a problem.\r\n",

        "description": "Mobility and the Internet of Things (IoT) have disrupted the corporate enterprise network on the scale that PCs disrupted mainframes in the 1980s. Yet most enterprises continue to approach security as if though there is still a hard perimeter with nothing but corporate-owned end points running against internal applications. Mobility, however, means employee-owned end points connecting over public carrier networks to cloud applications. Traditional perimeter security simply doesn’t address this.\r\n\r\nFrom mobile-based phishing to Bluetooth-based attacks, mobile and IoT have fundamentally changed the threat landscape. In this talk we will look at the modern threat landscape, the security controls currently available on the market (such as mobile threat defense and mobile application management), and provide real world examples of how they fall short under simulated attack. Finally, we will look at practical ways to improve enterprise security around mobile and IoT as well as cause the defensive products to evolve to be more robust.\r\n",

        "description": "In the past decade the software development paradigm has shifted to “deliver fast” -- with concomitant frameworks and methodologies to support that emphasis – but without proper consideration of quality. So most teams end up failing fast and hard when development continues beyond a shaky foundation. To bring about positive change, we must improve both our knowledge base and our processes to achieve quality delivery without disturbing the bookkeeper’s project delivery timelines. Lessons learned from a career in research science can be applied to QA, with parallels to industry product quality models. Testing techniques and product delivery processes from research science will aid not just testers but the entire team in delivering quality software. More than just day-to-day team activities and testing tools, the science of testing is about the pursuit of knowledge and understanding for its own sake. Testers should foster their skills in the community with professional development activities. Those in attendance will learn about the successes and failures of applying a scientist’s approach to testing software, from the “publish-or-perish” mindset of science to “deliver fast” in IT.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "Many folks think mobile apps don’t need to be PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant – but that’s true. So why do delivery teams think their apps are out of PCI scope, even when the app accepts card payments? Well, unless you dig through pages of documentation, understanding the relationship between PCI compliance and mobile apps is quite difficult.\r\n\r\nThis talk discusses the history of the PCI Data Security Standard and what PCI “compliance” means, particularly when looking at mobile apps. (Specifically – apps that run on consumer devices and do NOT use a hardware accessory with a validated Point-to-Point Encryption solution.)\r\n\r\nAttendees will walk away knowing why their delivery team should keep PCI compliance top of mind when developing mobile apps. Furthermore, they will have a list of actions their team can take to ensure their development process aligns with the PCI Data Security Standard.",

We will look at the major languages in use today and see how they work. We'll see some of the things they have in common, and the many things that make them distinctive. Finally, we’ll offer some suggestions on how to dive into learning these and using them on your own projects.",

Debugging is not a prescribed recipe, it is a necessary skill for any developer. While this ability is inevitably gained through experience, there are tips, tricks and techniques you can learn to level up your effectiveness as a programmer right now.\r\n\r\nFor the novice, student or new-grad, this session takes you through the most common things you don't know yet.\r\n\r\n•\thow to use breakpoints effectively (there's more to it than you think)\r\n•\twhat the heck step-into, step-over and step-out do\r\n•\thow to view and manipulate runtime state\r\n•\thow to use your environment's interactive terminal to interrogate your program\r\n•\twhat the stack is and how it contains a wealth of information\r\n•\tthe importance of Known Good Values (KGVs) in isolating a problem\r\n•\tknowing where to start by being a good investigator\r\n\r\nThis session saves you from all those stackoverflow.com downvotes and \"did you even debug this?\" comments.

Where do the boundaries of what we can do cross the line of what we should do? What responsibility do we have towards the users of the applications that we create?\r\n\r\nQuite often the average user of web and mobile applications do not understand privacy policies, have no idea why the application needs certain information (sometimes it doesn't!), and are afraid to not give permissions because the app might not work. They also often have no idea how dangerous it can be to have all their information out there.\r\n\r\nSome professions have a governing agency to enforce compliance to an ethical standard, but there is no governing agency over software developers. Does this mean we have no responsibility to be ethical in the software that we create or do we need to hold ourselves to some standard? And what would that standard be? With new innovation such as drones and autonomous vehicles, it seems more important than ever to consider ethics in software development.\r\n\r\nThis talk would not provide definitive solid answers to these questions because there is so much gray area in ethics, but it is more to get people thinking about what responsibilities we have as developers to the users of the software that we create.",

        "description": "Cross platform mobile solutions have traditionally meant a good enough fit on one platform and a square peg in a round hole for all of the others.  Yet the pressure to stop writing the same app twice on two platforms is constantly coming down from management.  How can one code base be shared between two platforms without dropping down to the lower levels of C/C++ or going down the dark and twisted path of Javascript?  \r\n\r\nIn 2011, Jetbrains, the company behind IntelliJ and other tools popular with developers released the first version of the Swift like language known as Kotlin.  Since then Kotlin has grown in popularity and features becoming a first class supported language on Android even.  In mid 2017 Jetbrains brought Kotlin out of the JVM/Android world and released a Kotlin compiler front end for the same compiler infrastructure that Objective-C and Swift use, LLVM.  Now today, it is possible to write code in a high level and type safe language geared toward developer productivity that works the way the host platform works.\r\n\r\nAttendees of this talk will learn enough about Kotlin to see why it is a compelling language and how to write code in said language that can be simultaneously compiled to both an Android library and native iOS framework.  Thus attendees will have gained the power to make management happy and hold onto that last thread of sanity.",

And -- it turns out -- definitions of microservices can vary, depending on what you want them to accomplish and how you want them to communicate with each other. So, just what are the three types of Microservices, what makes them unique, and when do you deploy each of them? \r\n\r\nIn this wide-ranging talk, you'll learn the difference between Stateless, Data-Centric, and Aggregator microservice models, how to identify which one you need to build, and the challenges to keeping each of the up and running in a complex distributed system. You'll also learn how to apply Nygaard's Stability Patterns (from his book, \"Release It!\") to ensure your Microservice components are stable and resilient throughout the software lifecycle.\r\n\r\nWhether you are new to MIcroservices or a veteran, a software developer or enterprise architect, this talk will help you get a handle on how to design and build successful Microservice components for you organization.\r\n",

As software developers, these are considerations we are constantly weighing, and composition is the key to doing all of them well. Functional languages in general (and my favorite Haskell specifically) have a whole language for discussing composition. This talk illustrates what these concepts are and how they relate to composition. Even if you aren’t interested in functional programming, this talk will teach you which decisions you are making in your OO code base today that will be speed bumps down the road.\t",

        "description": "[Presented by Guy Royse]\r\nBigfoot has been a staple of American folklore since the 19th century. Many people are convinced that Bigfoot is real. Others suggest that he is a cultural phenomenon. Some just want to believe. There is even a group, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, that tracks Bigfoot sightings. And they have thousands of reports available online that date back to the late 19th century.\r\n\r\nThe Internet, it seems, has everything.\r\n\r\nSo, I took this data, all 4,586 records of it, and used it to build a classifier. It was a good model with pleasing metrics. I liked it. But then what? For some folks, the model is where the work ends. But I'm a developer and that's only half the solution. I've got a model but how do I use it? How do I put it in an application so that a user can, well, use it?\r\n\r\nI'm going to answer that question in this talk, and a bit more. I'll show you how I exposed my Bigfoot classifier to the Internet as a REST-based API written in Python. And we'll tour a couple of applications I wrote to use that API: a web-based application written in JavaScript and an iOS application written in Swift. For the model itself, I'll use DataRobot since it's quick and easy. And, I work there!\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll know how to incorporate a model into an API of your own and how to use that API from your application. And, since all my code is on GitHub, you'll have some examples you can use for your own projects. As a bonus, you'll have 4,586 Bigfoot sightings to play with. And who doesn't want that?\t",

If so, what can architects do to promote, rather than impede, Lean and Agile practices within an organization? And above all, how can architects help an organization to keep up with the bewildering pace of technology change.\r\n\r\nKevin Fox, ICC's Director of Enterprise Architecture, has developed an “Agile Architect Manifesto” that reflects his real-world experience supporting Agile development teams and organizational technology adoption. In this session, he uses the manifesto to examine the characteristics of meaningful architecture in the context of Agile transformation.",

        "description": "What does testing and quality look like in a Continuous Delivery world? Who does what and how? Is there still a need for testers or do developers do all of the testing? Is it really possible to achieve quality when you deploy to production many times each day? What should testers do when there is no time for a “testing phase”? These are some of the questions many in the testing community ask as the software development industry moves toward this new paradigm of design and delivery.\r\n\r\nContinuous Delivery is a radical change in the way we build and deliver software and it requires a radical shift in the way we thing about and achieve quality. Join this veteran Agile coach as he shares his experience. In this presentation you will learn what has worked for several large organizations that have made the transition to this new approach.\r\n\r\nJoin Cheezy as he walks you through his Continuous Delivery World. He will start by building a definition of Continuous Delivery and explain why a company would want to go through such radical changes.  Next he will walk through in detail the three fundamental areas within an organization that must change – Development, Operations, and Product Management.  Not only will he talk about the details of those changes, he will give you the tools necessary to build your own roadmap. Finally he will talk about organizational changes companies can introduce that will make it easier to achieve this goal. If you are curious about Continuous Delivery or are in the process of adopting this advanced form of Agile this is one talk you will not want to miss.",

        "description": "The Vikings came from the land of ice and snow, from the midnight sun, where the hot springs flow. In addition to longships and bad attitudes, they had a system of writing that we, in modern times, have dubbed the Younger Futhark (or ᚠᚢᚦᚬᚱᚴ if you're a Viking). These sigils are more commonly called runes and have been mimicked in fantasy literature and role-playing games for decades.\r\n\r\nOf course, having an alphabet, runic or otherwise, solves lots of problems. But, it also introduces others. The Vikings had the same problem we do today. How were they to get their automated software systems to recognize the hand-carved input of a typical boatman? Of course, they were never able to solve this problem and were instead forced into a life of burning and pillaging. Today, we have deep learning and neural networks and can, fortunately, avoid such a fate.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we are going to build a Convolution Neural Network to recognize hand-written runes from the Younger Futhark. We'll be using Keras to write easy to understand Python code that creates and trains the neural network to do this. We'll wire this up to a web application using Flask and some client-side JavaScript so you can write some runes yourself and see if it recognizes them.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll understand how Convolution Neural Networks work, how to build your own using Python and Keras, and how to make it a part of an application using Flask. Maybe you'll even try seeing what it thinks of the Bluetooth logo?",

He will demonstrate its current capabilities, explain where it’s heading and will also give an overview of how you can use ZAP for automating security testing.\r\n",

But the process of finding and fixing accessibility problems when the product's almost out the door can take a long time. It saves a lot of time and effort to test for accessibility as features are being designed and developed, because it's easier to make changes to a feature when it's still a work in progress. There are a lot of simple techniques and free tools you can use to evaluate designs and code-in-progress. In this session, I'll show some of the best tools and techniques my team and I use when we're designing and building web applications.",

Employee retention is one of the most significant challenges that management experiences, often because of balancing engagement against burnout.  Yet, our companies need to keep running their existing services, while building new features.\r\n\r\nLeveraging his many years in Operations Engineering and running Product Teams, “Waldo will cover the ways that organizing around product teams rather than functional roles will:\r\n\r\n- keep people engaged with a high degree of ownership,\r\n- prevent burnout, attrition, and feelings of disempowerment by keeping authority aligned with responsibility, \r\n- allow the company to make informed decisions when new features may be built and run, \r\n- enable the company to determine when more capacity needs to be added to teams,\r\n- prevent applications from becoming orphaned or “Legacy”.\r\n\r\nYou will learn why organizing around job function rather than products causes more problems than it solves, as well as some of the pitfalls that must be negotiated or avoided when making a transition to a product-oriented structure.",

Code compiled to WebAssembly executes at near-native speeds, allowing developers to write performance-critical parts of their JavaScript application in a lower-level language for a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\nRust is a safe, concurrent, and fast programming language developed by Mozilla. Designed as a practical replacement for C and C++, it's used in production as a part of Firefox's rendering pipeline. Other users of Rust include Figma,  Deliveroo, and Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about building an application that renders a Mandlebrot fractal in the Web browser. The user interface for the application is built with regular ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Rust is used for generating the fractal.\r\n\r\nHere is an outline of the talk:\r\n\r\n- What is the Mandlebrot set?\r\n- What is WebAssembly? What is it good for?\r\n- What is the browser support for WebAssembly look like?\r\n- What is Rust? Why use Rust for anything?\r\n- How does Rust compile to WebAssembly?\r\n- How does code compiled to WebAssembly interact with JavaScript?\r\n- Hands-on demonstration, generating a fractal using Rust code\r\n- Can an entire Web application be built with Rust?\r\n\r\nAttendees don't have to be familiar with either Rust or WebAssembly to attend this talk.",

Perhaps you’re new to modern development, or maybe you’ve been too focused on your projects that you haven’t been able to come up for air. During the conference you will see the terms REST, API, and JSON in many of the session abstracts. Regardless of the topic - front end, back end, desktop, web, mobile - these concepts are becoming a part of your world very quickly. They play an increasingly-significant role in your current work and - very importantly - in your next job search. However, they are not complex concepts, and this session will quickly bring you up to speed and help you prepare for your next project as well as many of the other sessions you will attend at CodeMash.\r\n\r\nThis will be a language-independent and platform-independent jump-start into the concepts of REST, JSON, and APIs. We will walk through their meaning, their implementation, and how they’re used. You will see them in action during the session, and even after we leave the room on our way to snag more vendor swag, this session continues to work with you. Throughout the conference and the weeks following, you will have access to a simple server-side API against which you can make requests as you play with your own client side code, and you will be provided with a client from which to send requests as you play with your own server-side code.\r\n",

When it comes to building software, some software shops either skip the important step of threat modeling in secure software design or, they have tried threat modeling before but haven't quite figured out how to connect the threat models to real world software development and its priorities. \r\n\r\nThreat modeling should be part of your secure software design process. In this session we will look at some of the latest advances in threat modeling integrated with Agile Development processes by using User Stories and Abuser Stories. This process is iterative and meant to keep step with Agile Development practices. By enumerating Threats against User Stories / Abuser Stories, you are not threat modeling an entire/massive system, but going granular by enumerating threats against relevant user stories. Finally, you will see how this process facilitates the creation of multiple segues into Security Test Cases and Mitigation Plans. You will see how this process works with an automated approach to security test cases.",

You will learn how to attack a live application in all four ways, how to target specific areas of your application for heavier scrutiny, test for specific vulnerabilities, and incorporate ZAP with your development pipeline to automate the whole process including regression testing and report generation, so that vulnerabilities are discovered the moment they are introduced.",

When our code is full of names like doStuff and temp1 it can be hard to figure out what’s going on. This can cause confusion which leads to bugs and delays.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you’ll see concrete examples of how poor naming can cause big problems. We’ll then fix these issues while introducing tips for quick and effective naming. By the end you will have a clear understanding of what makes a good name, and how to improve your own code.",

They currently had no way to communicate beyond yes and no, and were struggling to find a way to spell out words. Despite having only used Vue.js for a few months, I was able to build a very simple app to allow them to communicate words and feelings. In this session, I'll explain how I created the app and deployed it to Amazon, enabling them to use it about an hour after the request. ",

        "description": "Have you ever tried to build a system to categorize text, images, or video as “offensive”? What about combinations of those three? With “memes” today, they have both images and text. Video can have all three. Somehow you are expected to grab a text scanning engine, have a way to analyze images for “adult” content, and scan all of that in a video stream. The problem has been around a while, and many have tried to solve it. Most of the solutions so far have been slamming together various bits of software packages and a lot of work to get them all to work together. Come to my talk and let me show you a first class method to attack that problem with code, machine learning, and the help of the almighty cloud. Not only will I demonstrate how to programmatically configure and control the content, but also how to include a human in the process for the more difficult decisions. I will have code demonstrations and a ton of fun talking about how to deal with folks like myself that sometime cross the “line”.",

        "description": "Have you wished your Java program would run faster?  Maybe you were seeking a JVM based scripting language to perform as great as Java ?  Wouldn't it be cool if you could transpile your polygot language to native binary?  Then you might have just found the holy grail. Wait the spelling is misleading, but the results are not, introducing GraalVM.  This is a universal virtual machine that can take any JVM language and convert it to a faster bytecode embedded in the JVM, or compile via LLVM to a native application.  Examples will include Java, JavaScript, and Kotlin.  The attendee will leave this session understanding how to get started optimizing their Java applications as well as how any JVM based scripting language can gain native speeds.\r\n",

You’ve stuck with the existing processes and tools because it’s what you know. After all, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”  Right? \r\n\t\t\r\nI have good news!  With only a few new skills and free tools from Microsoft, you can join the Agile & DevOps revolution to help accelerate your team, product, and data infrastructure.\r\n\t\t\r\nIn this session I’ll use the newest version of SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) to model an existing database and then demonstrate each step from modification to a working, automated deployment. By the end of the session, you'll see how continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) can revolutionize your SQL Server database development.\r\n \t\t\r\nAfter seeing the possibilities, you'll be ready to change those old processes. And in no time at all, you’ll be the talk of the team as they try to keep pace with you!\r\n\r\nThis talk is applicable to both SQL Server DBA's and Full-stack .NET devs that use SQL Server as their data platform.",

For those scenarios that should automated, every team must adopt an implementation plan to ensure value is derived from reliable automated test execution. In this session, the audience will learn how to automate both strategically and tactically to maximize the benefits of automation. Entry criteria will be demonstrated for automation in the development lifecycle along with a set of checks to determine automation feasibility & ROI. ",

You don't even need a device to get started! Create an experience in the Unity 3D engine, which supports C# for programmatic manipulation of objects. We'll then step through the process for building Unity projects as Universal Windows Platform (UWP) solutions, maintaining them in version control, and deploying them for testing to the HoloLens emulator in Visual Studio.",

We will be looking at database server configurations, using MSSQL database profiling tools and understanding Query Execution Plans to get the most out of Entity Framework. In the end, learning to be an Entity Framework detective will make your project sound and snappy.",

A login is more than a Single Sign On, we can use Passwordless, Federated Identity (FB, GitHub), Multifactor Authentication. \r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this talk is gain an in-depth knowledge of those terms, in addition explore some PaaS, that can help to achieve all that in our projects easier and faster.",

If not done well they can become maintenance nightmares or worse yet, open up security risks to your backend infrastructure.  Inspired by the 12 factor app set of guidelines and iOS-factor.com this talk takes a hard look at the bad practices we use today in mobile development and talks about what we should be doing instead.  Whether you’re responsible for writing Android or iOS apps this talk will help you level up your app and maybe even prevent you from accidentally DDOS’ing your backend services. ",

They are all well known IT organizations that practice continuous delivery and deployment (CDD). This helps them reduce the risk associated with releasing code, improve system resiliency, and reduce overall software development costs. At any point and often multiple times per day, they deploy the latest changes to their production environment with full confidence because their builds have been tested automatically. In this session you will learn how to continuously deliver with confidence. You will learn how to set up a development pipeline for a sample application. Step by step, individual tasks will be assembled and linked together to form a pipeline that takes a code change from source control all the way to a live production environment. But a pipeline is just the start. Along the way you will learn how you can use feature toggles, fast failures, small changes, and optimized tests to encourage a culture of CDD right now.​",

But it always gets tricky when it comes to the data. \"Code is easy, state is hard\" is the motto often used. Naturally, a lot of Microservices architectures do not speak of the data aspect, leaving it up to you to figure it out.\r\nFrom an academic standpoint, microservices should be completely decoupled and isolated, while from a data management academic point of view, all data should reside in one place only. Both are mutually exclusive, academically. In a practical world, both have to work together and meet somewhere in the middle.\r\nIn this session, you will learn how to apply data management approaches to a Microservices environment. You will get to understand where the synergies between the two lie and how to avoid common pitfalls, so that you can apply the best of both worlds in your next application design yourself.",

You’ll learn how a CPU turns the code we feed it into actions, what’s the big difference between an ARM and an Intel processor, how CPU’s constantly optimize work for us, and where is it all going for the next few years.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll show how Meltdown and Spectre take advantage of CPU internals to expose data and why this class of security problems are going to be a challenge to the next generation of CPU's.\r\n",

        "description": "Testing software in an automated fashion is one of the best ways to guarantee quality, reduce bugs, and prevent regressions in our code, and is a prerequisite to operating in a Continuous Integration environment. Unfortunately, the most difficult parts of testing come right at the beginning: scaffolding a test suite and writing our very first tests. For those who are new to automated testing, these hurdles can prove overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThis talk covers the fundamentals of testing, in a beginner-friendly way. We'll discuss how testing makes software better, the various levels of the Automation Pyramid, how to scaffold some basic unit and integration tests, and discuss the characteristics of great tests.",

I've also been a programmer professionally for 10+ years and I've always been... was that a butterfly?  It sure was pretty.  I wonder what species it is?  I should go find out... but I also needed to submit those change requests and oh wait here's that TODO list I misplaced yesterday, need to investigate that...\r\n\r\nWait, what was I doing again?\r\n\r\nProgramming being a mentally-intensive occupation, it's quite easy to get distracted and lose the focus that is so critical to good development.  This session will cover a bunch of tips, trials, failures, and successes I've picked up during my career as a distracted developer, including different focus techniques, structures which can improve time-management skills and an overview of the various methods used to redirect distracted individuals and help them focus.  If you find yourself easily distracted, even if you don't have a medical condition like I do, you'll find something to use in this session.  \r\n\r\nDistraction is the enemy.  You can't beat it forever, but you can ward it off.  This session will show you how.",

During this talk we will break down the basic concepts, build our own command bus, discuss pros and cons, and review different frameworks that make this work easy. By creating our own command bus we can see exactly what it does and how it works so that it will no longer be a black box. This will give you a practical introduction so that you can get started implementing this in your apps today.",

        "description": "DevOps has been a buzzword for quite a few years. But to truly implement DevOps, an organization must be willing to blend the development group with operations. This is very difficult, as development tends to think in terms of backlog, but operations tends to think in terms of tickets. From experience, this purist form of DevOps rarely works. But there is one concept that seems to be universally accepted as a DevOps practice that can radically alter the effectiveness of your organizational software delivery: automating the delivery pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis session focuses on the idea of continuous everything, taken from years of experience consulting clients in building pipelines to support microservices architecture. The concepts and practices presented in this session are easily migrated to other architectural forms. In general, the session covers practices starting with “continuous”, including Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Inspection. While this content of the session is tool agnostic, you will be presented with a sample set of tools that you can use to automate different portions of your software delivery pipeline, including Jenkins, Chef and Puppet, Bamboo, and Docker.\r\n\r\nTopics you will learn include:\r\n*  How to build a toolkit for automating your delivery pipeline\r\n*  Sample roadmaps to get from zero to complete automation\r\n*  The importance of different types of monitoring\r\n*  Migrating to a DevOps culture",

        "description": "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be visually or hearing impaired and how that would affect your daily interactions? Why not build products that would provide a better user experience for wider range of customers? With the big Chatbot revolution, Bots are everywhere and are changing the norms of human-computer interactions. Chatbots provide the perfect opportunity for business to attract/retain customers, drive up user engagement and make brands more inviting.\r\nIn this session let's build an Alexa skill and a Lex chatbot to make a sample website accessible to everyone. The goal would be to use Lex as a website companion to help everyone navigate all of the website's content. Let's design voice commands that read text from website, make phone calls and display query results making it possible for every type of user to use the site.\r\nYou will leave this session with an understanding of how to integrate conversational user interface in products you build to achieve better user experience for ALL!",

In this session I will show you why current 2FA implementations using SMS are inadequate and what other options exist. I’ll also show off some modern software and hardware authenticators and then dive into some code showing how to integrate them into ASP.NET Core.

This session takes a practical look at the SOLID principles to see how they can be applied to new and existing applications to make them better over time.

While today they tend to be large, expensive, or otherwise visible and consciously acquired, in the near future these devices will be ubiquitous, pervasive, and if we're not careful, invasive. \r\n\r\nThere are many (https://iotmark.wordpress.com, https://www.thingscon.com/iot-trustmark, https://www.bvdw.org/presse/detail/artikel/digitalbranche-befuerwortet-datentransparenz-bei-iot-geraeten/ etc) efforts underway to find a framework to enable consumers to better understand what exactly they are getting when inviting these connected devices into their homes. What data is being collected? What happens if the company goes out of business? \r\n\r\nThis talk is an overview of the current thoughts and best practices that should be considered while designing a connected device (or service based on connected devices), and is appropriate for everyone from consumers to interested practitioners.

        "description": "Have you ever wondered what makes you tick? What are the different factors that elevates you to peak performance level and makes you an awesome developer/tester? I was curious about this and went through a journey of self exploration in the past several years. This journey consisted of me identifying different patterns based on my real life experiences developing/testing software, interacting with various people, reading books and doing a lot of research on productivity, mindfulness and self motivation and finally not watching television for 6 months in 2017. Based on this exploration, I realized that no matter who you are, where you are from or what you do; there are 3 key factors that makes people reach their fullest potential and make them a strong tester.\r\n\r\nCome join this talk, where I share my real life story of how I stumbled into testing, how I did not have proper guidance and had to figure my way out of different obstacles both in personal and corporate life, how I started from being a nobody to who I am today, where I speak at multiple conferences, write for various magazines, mentor budding engineers, share my ideas via my youtube channel and built a strong professional network which has helped me become an influential person who can make effective contributions to the software community. I will share different tips, tricks and tools I learned throughout my career which can help anyone become a strong influential developer/tester.",

Over time, you may even miss the simplicity of old monoliths. In this session, I propose a combination of infrastructure, architecture, and design principles to bulletproof your microservices and make them easy to maintain with a combination of high scalability, elasticity, fault tolerance, and resilience.\r\n\r\nThis session will include a discussion of microservices blueprints like: asynchronous communications, avoiding cascading failures in synchronous calls, and how distributed NoSQL databases become valuable in terms of scalability and performance when combined with your microservices in a Kubernetes deployment.",

        "description": "[Presented by Russell Fustino]\r\nVideo streaming apps are all the rage and continue to demonstrate rapid growth in usage and creative implementations. Every vertical market has the need for video apps. So, you want to learn how to build a video streaming app, but you don’t know where to get started or you are not a video expert? Or maybe you are just curious about video technology? Then, this session is for you! To build a live-streaming app for iOS and Android, you don’t have to be a video expert. Using a mobile SDK and cloud streaming service can help you quickly and easily integrate live video into an existing app or service or build a livestream app from the ground up. Using these tools, you can build anything from a basic one-way broadcasting platform to a fully interactive live-streaming app that allows users to create and share their own videos. This is referred to as user generated content. It’s all about the tools, huh? What about the need for speed? More and more apps demand real-time streaming delivery—such as those for gaming, financial trading, auctions or interactive experiences like HQ Trivia—you need an API that’s built for speed. Learn how to send live streams to destinations around the world with the goal to minimize the latency time it takes to display a live video from glass to glass. That is, from the glass of the recording device glass to the glass of the end viewer’s screen.\r\n\r\nJoin Russ Fustino, Wowza Developer Evangelist, in this informative session and see how easy it is to get started building iOS and Android apps using video streaming with actual latency in the sub 3 second range anywhere on the globe. Times are changing. Keep up with the times. \r\n\r\nHope to see you at the session! What you will learn in this session:\r\n• How to use video streaming in iOS and Android apps.\r\n• How to use video streaming sample code.\r\n• How to reduce latency of the stream.\r\n• Learn about video streaming basics.\r\n• API code and Video SDK.",

        "description": "Would you bet your career and your company's reputation on a technology you've never used in front of 110 million people tuned into a Super Bowl commercial? Well, I did. And I was a nervous wreck! We were launching a new product during a commercial at the Super Bowl 302 days away, and I was betting everything on a technology we had never used in production. I spent countless nights wavering back and forth thinking about the millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of person hours that were on the line. Everything was resting on the shoulders of this one web service that had to handle the excessive load placed upon it when our commercial aired. The technology chosen was Erlang, a mystical, functional, dynamically compiled language that was very foreign to this eight-time Microsoft MVP. This is a story about picking the right tool for the right job, exploring other possibilities, and the difference between playing with technology and putting it into production. As a noted storyteller, I'll take you on the journey of:\r\n\r\n*how we stumbled upon Erlang during our dedicated innovation time\r\n*what made it so special that we were willing to take such a risk\r\n*what we learned along the way\r\n*how it performed\r\n*and would we do it again\r\n\r\nIf you love a great technology story, I hope you'll join me for this tale of how this web service, built in unproven technology to us, survived Super Bowl Sunday.

In this interactive session, a member of the audience will drive the speaker's laptop as we examine a piece of Poorly Written Code and challenge the habits used to write the code. We will address perceptions on why developers like to rely on comments and give suggestions for how code can be refactored for comments to be removed. By end of the session we will have Well Designed Code that will challenge perceptions on how to write Good Code and help improve overall Code Quality and Working Habits. ",

Still, it seems like Swift has been slower to adopt promises than other languages. Promises can make tangled networking code more readable and can simplify complicated API business. Let’s take a look at how a tangle of calls to separate API’s, some using information dependent on previous calls, can be simplified into a series of promises fulfilled or rejected. We’ll investigate how promises can make unit testing easier, the pros and cons of various promise frameworks for Swift and of the promise pattern itself.",

        "description": "First thing I do when walking into an interview is to see if there’s a whiteboard hanging on the wall. If there is, there’s a good chance somebody’s going to ask me to write code on there, and nobody’s gonna get any useful information out of the experience. There's also a good chance somebody’s going to ask me to tell them about a time I handled a difficult situation, and maybe even how I’d move Mount Fuji.\r\n\r\nThis is a session on how to have meaningful technical interviews and really learn if a candidate will be good for your team, hard skills and soft skills. I will also give away the two question code quiz, explain why these two are valuable, and how to administer them well.",

We'll address new defensive strategies such as modern JavaScript framework defense in Angular, React and other frameworks. We'll also look at how CSP deployment has changed in the past 7 years illustrating the progressive use of content security which supports CSP v1, v2 and v3 concurrently. We will then look at advances in HTML sanitization on both the client and server side as well as focus on sanitizers and defensive libraries that have stood the test of time in terms of maintenance and security. We'll also look at interesting design topics such as how HTML injection is still critical even in the face of rigorous XSS defense and how HTTPOnly cookies are largely ineffective. This talk should help developers and security professionals alike build a focused and modern strategy to defend against XSS in modern applications.\r\n",

This will be an honest look at what worked, what didn't work, as well as a follow-up analysis. There will be plenty of stories, common sense perspective, as well as discussion around goal-setting and execution. This will be the talk I wish I had two years ago when I was starting this adventure.\r\n\r\nFrom this talk, you'll walk away with: \r\n* honest assessments of \"best practices\" and how they apply to security in DevOps environments (and a call to action to think critically about best practices!)\r\n* recommendations of how to setup a DevOps oriented security program \r\n* practical ideas on where to spend time and what to delay\r\n* some entertainment at the expense of some of my failures in learning these lessons",

Animations help users understand state changes, guide them to notice meaningful information, gather focus to a required action, or express relationships between UI elements. This session examines traditional techniques using property and drawable animations, as well as the new MotionLayout introduced at Google I/O 2018. These techniques can expand content, display state, move elements, and highlight important controls. Properly executed animation effects are applicable to buttons, lists, and images in any Android app, taking an app's user experience from good to great.",

        "title": "Power BI Custom Data Connectors - Your Data, Delivered!",
        "description": "Your company uses Power BI for many projects and reporting needs, and often you're the one who finds, gets and cleans the data in order to make it useful. Wouldn't it be better if you could create a plugin for Power BI that would enable them to import the data, pre-cleaned and ready to use?\r\n \r\nThis session will start with an overview of the Power Query (M) language used within Excel, Power BI and SSAS. From there I'll  demonstrate how to use the Power Query SDK with Visual Studio to create a new plugin for Power BI Desktop, touching on what additional features are only available through Custom Data Connectors. I'll code an end-to-end example that pulls data from an external web service, adding features like custom authentication and navigation tables to make the data easily accessible to users. \r\n\r\nYou'll leave this session with enough knowledge to create your first connector and solidify your superhero status in a data-hungry world.\r\n",

        "description": "CSS is easy, right? Yet why is it that every project’s CSS styles seem to get out-of-control and frustrating so quickly? The global nature of CSS allows tremendous flexibility, but without a plan and enforced structure, styles get out of hand. In this session, learn how to reign in the global nature of CSS by following a series of foundational principles that will allow your team to collaborate on styles in a structured way that is easier for everyone to understand and prevents the oh-so-often collision of styles. You’ll walk away with more insight on:\r\n\r\n- Naming CSS classes\r\n- 7 types of CSS rules\r\n- Leveraging key features of Sass for code simplicity\r\n- Strategies for code organization and source ordering\r\n\r\nOnce you understand and implement these principles of CSS architecture, creating or changing styles in your project will no longer be the terrifying proposition it once was.",

        "description": "Automated browser tests can be a nightmare to write and maintain. Unlike unit tests they’re tough to set up, slow to run, make permanent changes to data, and they’re incredibly brittle. Even a tiny CSS change can result in cascading failures!\r\n\r\nYou can’t ignore these issues, but you CAN design around them by adopting a few key patterns and techniques. Data creation helpers let you construct intricate data graphs in one line of code. Page Objects abstract away tedious browser automation code and make tests resilient to changes in HTML structure. You'll also see some anti-patterns that are definitely NOT fun to write. Developers will leave this session prepared to inject some newfound joy into their UI testing efforts. (Some examples use WebDriver, although the session is largely test tool agnostic)",
